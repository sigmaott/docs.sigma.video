## Make a copy of your Profile

**Condition**: The profile has been created before and is displayed in the profile list.

The parameters in the profile are many, and configuring each parameter takes a long time for the user. Therefore, you can make copies from existing profiles and edit some of the information you want.

A content administrator (CMS) has the ability to make copies of all existing profiles in the list and edit the parameters of new profiles without affecting existing profiles.

**Step 1**:

At the main interface, users can make copies by moving their mouse on the 'Clone' icon in the action column of the profile they want to clone.

**Step 2:** When the user clicks on the 'Duplicate' icon, the system will open a pop-up window **Duplicate Profile** in the middle of the screen, displaying the previously entered data.

**Step 3:** After the user makes changes and presses the 'Confirm' button, the system will automatically create a new profile. A successful update message will appear on the screen and then the window will close automatically after 5 seconds.
