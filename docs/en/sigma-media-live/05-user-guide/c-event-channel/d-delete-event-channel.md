# Delete an event channel

**Condition**: To perform this function, at least one event channel needs to be previously created and visible in the event channel list

This is only possible when the event channel is in **Stop or Done** status.

**Step 1**: On the event channel list screen, at the channel you want to delete, hover over the **Delete** icon in the Action column, and then tap the **Delete** icon.

The system will display a confirmation pop-up window in the center of the screen with the following details:

- Subject: Warning
- Content: Are you sure to delete the event channel. Continue?
- **Cancel** button: Make no changes, return to the Event Channel List screen.
- **Agree** button: The system deletes all information of the event channel.

**Step 2**: The user presses the **OK** button to delete the event channel information.

The system displays a message **Delete event channel successfully** in the right corner of the screen and automatically closes the notification after 5 seconds.

At the same time, the system performs **delete the entire event channel**

Note: Refrain from using this feature because deleting it will not be restored
