# View a list of alerts

The alert list interface is an important part of managing problems (wave, hardware, output) when the channel crashes. The interface in the list includes basic information about the alert such as start time, alert level, alert type,... and enables quick search, helping administrators manage issues and troubleshoot them promptly.

On the main screen of Media Live, select **Alerts** in the header tab.

The system home screen displays the alert list screen interface.
