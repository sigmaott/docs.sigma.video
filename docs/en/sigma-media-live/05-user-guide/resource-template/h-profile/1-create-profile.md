# Profile

The profile profile information includes some important information for configuring the video conversion process. This information may vary depending on the specific platform, application, or tool the user is using to convert the video, to ensure that the generated video is of good quality and compatible with the viewer's device and network.

### Purpose

Support users to have the ability to choose and customize the profile as desired when creating channels.

### Scope

This profile is used for all features of the media-live service.

# Create a new profile

Create a new profile by following these steps:
**Step 1**: In the profile list, click the '+Add New' button in the right corner of the screen.
The system will display a pop-up **Add new profile**\* in the middle of the screen.

- [New preset](./1-create-profile#new-preset)

### Presets already exist

For quick configuration, users can select 'existing presets' – presets configured in the system.
The system will display a window.

- The list includes:
  - ID
  - Name: the name of the preset
  - Type: [video/ audio/ data] respectively
  - Information: Profile details

- Refresh

**Step 3**: The user selects a preset from the list.

The system will return to the Create new profile pop-up window with updated data from the selected preset.

### New preset
