## Update Profile

**Condition**: The profile has been created before and is displayed in the profile list.

Adjustments after editing the profile will **not affect** the profile assigned to the channel.

Content administrators (CMS) can make modifications to profile parameters, even when the profile is being assigned to the channel.

**Step 1**:

At the main interface, users can make modifications by moving their mouse on the 'Edit' icon in the action column of the profile they want to edit.

**Step 2:**

When the user clicks on the 'edit' icon, the system will open a pop-up window **Update Profile** in the middle of the screen, displaying the previously entered data.

**Step 3:**

After the user makes changes and presses the 'Confirm' button, the system will automatically save the newly updated information. A successful update message will appear in the right corner of the screen, and then the window will automatically close after 5 seconds.
