# Create input copies

The user wants to make 1 copy with the previously existing input, keeping the previously required settings of the input

**Condition**: To perform this process, it is necessary to have at least 1 input that was previously generated and displayed in the input list (Transcode/Package)

**Step 1:** At the input list screen, click the **Make copy** icon in the Action column at the field you want to duplicate

After that, a pop-up window will appear, displaying the previously entered information, allowing the user to edit all the information fields

**Default input name: Copy of [Input Name] - if the user does not change the name.**

**Step 2:** The user enters the required information.

**Step 3:** Once completed, the user presses the **Confirm** button

The system displays a notification of successful execution in the right corner of the screen and automatically closes the notification after 5 seconds.
