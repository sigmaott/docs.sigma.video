## Permission

An account is created and granted certain permissions and may only perform operations corresponding to the allowed permissions.

### Decentralization rules

The system will be divided into many different permissions, each of which will include two basic information:

- Identifier: refers to the object or entity that the right will influence.

  For example, the 'Sigma Livestream' permission denotes the object it affects as the 'Livestream'.
- Actions: represent actions that are allowed to be executed on an entity assigned with permissions. It is about answering the question _What can a user do with entity A?_

  The system defines two actions for working with permissions:

  - READ: Users can only view entity information.
  - FULL: users can view and edit entity information.

    When setting permissions, only one of these two actions can be selected.
