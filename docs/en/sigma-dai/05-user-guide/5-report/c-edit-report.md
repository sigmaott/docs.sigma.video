# Edit Report

The edit report feature allows you to update and adjust previously created reports to meet changing needs.

## How to Access the Edit Report Function

There are two ways to access the edit report function:

### Method 1: From the Reports List

1. In the reports list interface, find the report you want to edit.
2. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon) in the actions column of that report.

### Method 2: From the Report Results Screen

1. When viewing a report's results, click the **Edit Report** button in the top right corner of the screen.

## Components That Can Be Edited

The edit report interface is similar to the create report interface, allowing you to update the following components:

### Basic Information

- **Report Name**: Update the report name.
- **Description**: Update the report description.

### Report Parameters

## Save Changes

After completing your edits to the report, you have two options:

- **Save**: Click the **Save** button to save changes without running the report.
- **Save and Run**: Click the **Save & Run** button to save changes and run the report immediately with the new parameters.

## View Change History

The system stores the history of report versions, allowing you to:

- See who made previous changes.
- See when changes were made.
- See details of changes that were made.

## Important Notes

- When editing a report, changes are only applied after you save them.
- If someone else is viewing the report, they will not see your changes until they refresh the page.
- Editing a report does not affect scheduled reports or previously saved results.
