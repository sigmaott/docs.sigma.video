# Delete Report

The delete report feature allows you to remove reports that are no longer used or needed from the system.

## Important Warning

> **Note**: The action of deleting a report cannot be undone. After deletion, the report and related results will be permanently lost. Make sure you really want to delete the report before proceeding.

## How to Delete a Report

There are two ways to delete a report:

### Method 1: Delete from the Reports List

1. In the reports list interface, find the report you want to delete.
2. Click the **Delete** button (trash icon) in the actions column of that report.
3. The system will display a confirmation dialog. Read the message carefully and click **Confirm** if you want to proceed with deletion.
4. The system will delete the report and display a success confirmation message.

### Method 2: Delete from the Report Results Screen

1. When viewing a report's results, click the **Delete Report** button (trash icon) in the top right corner of the screen.
2. The system will display a confirmation dialog. Read the message carefully and click **Confirm** if you want to proceed with deletion.
3. After confirmation, the system will delete the report and redirect you to the reports list page.

## Delete Multiple Reports at Once

To delete multiple reports at once:

1. In the reports list interface, check the selection boxes to the left of the reports you want to delete.
2. After selecting the reports, click the **Delete Selected** button at the top of the list.
3. The system will display a confirmation dialog with the number of reports to be deleted. Read the message carefully and click **Confirm** if you want to proceed with deletion.
4. The system will delete all selected reports and display a success confirmation message.

## Notes When Deleting Reports

- **Scheduled Reports**: If the report has been scheduled to run automatically, deleting the report will also cancel the established schedule.
- **Shared Reports**: If the report has been shared with other users, deleting the report will prevent those users from accessing it.
- **Saved Results**: All saved results of the report will be permanently deleted.
- **Deletion Rights**: Only the report creator or an administrator has the right to delete a report.

## Recover Deleted Reports

In some cases, the system may allow recovery of deleted reports within a limited time period after deletion (depending on system configuration):

1. Access the **Recently Deleted Reports** section (if available) in the reports interface.
2. Find the report you want to recover and click the **Restore** button.
3. The system will restore the report and return it to the main reports list.

> **Note**: The recovery feature may not be available in all cases. If there is no recovery option, report deletion is permanent.
