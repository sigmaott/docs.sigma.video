# Edit your channel

**Condition**: The channel has been created before and is displayed in the channel list.

Adjustments during the modification of the livestream channel will affect the information of the channel itself and be displayed in the corresponding channel details.

Users of the content management system (CMS) can make edits on the parameters of the channel, including in the case of an active channel.

**Step 1**:

At the main screen interface, users can make edits by moving the mouse on the 'Edit' icon in the Action column at the desired field.

**Step 2:** When the user clicks on the edit icon, the system will display a pop-up **Update channel edit** in the middle of the screen, displaying the previously entered information.
