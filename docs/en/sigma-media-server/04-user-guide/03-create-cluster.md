## Create a new Cluster Server

Creating cluster servers helps users to group machines together into a cluster, making it easier to support each other to handle tasks between machines. Specifically, the combined machines can support each other in the event of a machine death or malfunction.

1. Access the Cluster Server management section with the type of machine you want to add

2. Click "Add new server cluster"

3. In the server cluster configuration form, users perform configuration with the following information:
