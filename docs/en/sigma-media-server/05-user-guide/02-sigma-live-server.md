With adding licenses users can do it in 2 ways:

##### Method 1: Go to Manage licenses

Perform the manipulations:

1. Click "Add license".

9. Confirm license usage
   ![](.. /image/user-guide/license-use-confirm.png)

The license has now been successfully assigned to the machine, the machine is ready to receive jobs for processing.
:::Tip
If you already have a license in an "Available" status, you can perform "Use" the license immediately (Done from step 7).
